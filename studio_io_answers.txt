Exercise 1: Run `cat` and describe what happens?
When I ran the command `cat` and pressed Enter, the program waited for input.
When I typed text and pressed Enter, the same text appeared on the screen.
This happens because `cat` reads from standard input (the keyboard)
and writes to standard output (the terminal).
When I pressed CTRL-D, the program terminated because CTRL-D sends
an end-of-file (EOF) signal.

Exercise 2: Run `cat < mars.txt` and describe what happens.
When I ran `cat < mars.txt`, the contents of mars.txt were printed
to the screen.
The `<` operator redirects standard input so that instead of reading
from the keyboard, the program reads from the file.

Exercise 3: Run `cat < mars.txt > new.txt` and describe what happens.
When I ran `cat < mars.txt > new.txt`, nothing was printed to the screen.
The contents of mars.txt were copied into new.txt.
The `<` operator redirected input from mars.txt, and the `>` operator
redirected output into new.txt instead of the terminal.

Exercise 4: Run `cat > new.txt` and describe what happens.
When I ran `cat > new.txt`, the program waited for me to type text.
Everything I typed was written into new.txt.
When I pressed CTRL-D, the program ended and the file contained
exactly what I typed. The `>` operator overwrites the file.

Exercise 5: Run `cat >> new.txt` and describe what happens.
When I ran `cat >> new.txt`, the text I typed was added to the end
of the file instead of replacing it.
The `>>` operator appends to the file instead of overwriting it.

Exercise 6: What header file is required for read() and write()?
The required header file is: #include <unistd.h>

Exercise 7: What is the return value type of read()?
The return value type of read() is ssize_t.

Exercise 8: What return value indicates end-of-file?
A return value of 0 indicates end-of-file.

Exercise 9: Does modifying bufferSize affect correctness?
Changing bufferSize does not affect correctness as long as the
program correctly uses the return value from read().
If bufferSize is very small (even equal to 1) the program still works.
However, it will perform more system calls and run slower.

Exercise 10: What is the tradeoff between small and large buffers?

Small buffer:
- Uses less memory
- More system calls
- Slower performance

Large buffer:
- Uses more memory
- Fewer system calls
- Faster performance

The tradeoff is between memory usage and performance.
